# ER_sim
Network simulation function based on Erdős–Rényi model

This function takes an igraph graph object as an input and simulates random graphs based on the Erdős–Rényi model. The graph object input should be directed and can be weighted or unweighted, but the ER Model only provides unweighted network statistic results. The function produces graphs that show the distribution of transitivity, average shortest path length, average degree, and density. 

You'll be asked to input a monicker for the graph object, which will be used in the title of the resulting distribution plots.
